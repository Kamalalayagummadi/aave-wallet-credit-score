# üõ°Ô∏è Wallet Risk Scoring from On-Chain Activity

## üìå Problem Statement

Given a list of 100 wallet addresses, this project:
- Fetches their Compound V2 on-chain transactions
- Engineers relevant features to reflect wallet risk
- Scores each wallet on a scale from **0 (high risk)** to **1000 (low risk)**

## ‚úÖ Tasks Completed

1. **Transaction Data Collection** using Covalent API  
2. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Transaction count
   - Total ETH transferred
   - Number of successful txs
   - Average gas price
   - Inbound vs outbound transfers
   - Days since last tx
3. **Risk Score Generation**
   - Feature normalization
   - Weighted scoring logic
4. **Final Output CSV** with `wallet_id` and `score`
